              My Hobbies
            </h1>
            <p>I have had many hobbies growing up. My hobbies helped me relax and enjoy many aspects of life that I would have never been able 
                to access without them. Some of them brought me a challenge, joy, or they were just a good past time.
            </p>
      
            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is skiing. It brings the life back to me by exposing me to the fresh cold air of the snow covered mountains.
                As well, I have attained a level of proficiency in which I can try to specialize in a specific aspect of the sport. For me, I have decided I wanted to 
                specialize in the Super G as I love to try to push the limits of speed I can attain on skis.
            </p>

            <p>Another of my hobbies is sailing. Sadly, I can't do that in Colorado as most bodies of water aren't large enough. As well, during the winter, if the water 
                freezes, I can't use it either.
            </p>

            <p>As well, I enjoy other things such as video games, watching sports, hanging out with friends, and other leasurely activities.

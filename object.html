            <p>In this lab, you will see a circuit I built to make an LED work. We used equipment that is givent to us in our ELEGOO Arduino Uno Starter Kit. The purpose of this lab was to introduce us to how it is to build a circuit and what we may face while making one.

              <h2>Problems and Conclusion
              </h2>
              <p>While doing this lab, there were problems that were ran into while making the circuit. One problem was getting the wires properly integrated into the circuit to allow power supply. Another was properly aligning every element to allow power transfer. In the later stages, the problem faced was trying to find the right placement for the switch.

                In this lab, we were taught how to use our new tools and the process of making a functional circuit. As well, we were taught some safety tips to prevent injury, damage to property, and how to keep a safe learning environment. It was a good introduction as it was simple enough that it showed the issues that can be faced when making a circuit and will help us plan ahead in future labs on how to approach them.
